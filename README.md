This mod will automatically collect selected items. It is useful for collecting the same items. This mod also does NBT comparisons, so you can collect items that have the same tag (etc. enchantment) as the selected item. At startup, config/collect-items/list.nbt is generated and the selected items are stored there.

## Config
- **collectItems**: If true, this mod is enable.
- **openGUI**: If set hotkey, open config gui when pressed selected keys.
- **storeItem**: If set hotkey, store item with nbt when pressed selected keys.
